    Parameters
    ----------
    search_depth : int (optional)
        A strictly positive integer (i.e., 1, 2, 3,...) for the number of
        layers in the game tree to explore for fixed-depth search. (i.e., a
        depth of one (1) would only explore the immediate sucessors of the
        current state.)

    score_fn : callable (optional)
        A function to use for heuristic evaluation of game states.

    timeout : float (optional)
        Time remaining (in milliseconds) when search is aborted. Should be a
        positive value large enough to allow the function to return before the
        timer expires.

        **************  YOU DO NOT NEED TO MODIFY THIS FUNCTION  *************

        For fixed-depth search, this function simply wraps the call to the
        minimax method, but this method provides a common interface for all
        Isolation agents, and you will replace it in the AlphaBetaPlayer with
        iterative deepening search.

        Parameters
        ----------
        game : `isolation.Board`
            An instance of `isolation.Board` encoding the current state of the
            game (e.g., player locations and blocked cells).

        time_left : callable
            A function that returns the number of milliseconds left in the
            current turn. Returning with any less than 0 ms remaining forfeits
            the game.

        Returns
        -------

            Board coordinates corresponding to a legal move; may return
